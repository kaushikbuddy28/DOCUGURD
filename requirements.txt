# Project Dependencies

This is a Next.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) project, not a Python project. Dependencies are managed in the `package.json` file.

To install the necessary packages, please run the following command in your terminal from the project's root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download and install all the libraries and tools listed under `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in the `package.json` file.
